        <h2>About this page</h2>
        <h3>In this page, I'm gonna explain the weapons of video game Conqueror's Blade(It's kind of memo of Conqueror's blade for me)</h3>
        <br></br>
        <h2>Weapon</h2>

        <h3>Shortsword & Shield.</h2>
            <img src="asset/images/ShortSwordAndShield.png" alt="ShortSwordAndShield">
        <p>The weapon that are good at defense. It has really fast cooldown of skill, so it can fight long time on frontline.
            However, it specialized for military commanders, the destructive power of the corps is the lowest level among melee weapons.
            This weapon's role is to attack the military commanders as much as you can. 
            For me, it is good for newer like me, it's stable and powerful, but not fun while using it.</p>
        <p>(Tip.This weapon is called as strongest weapon for 1v1)</p>
        <br></br>
        <h3>Spear</h3>
            <img src="asset/images/Spear.png" alt="Spear">
        <p>There are many skills to swing a long spear around, and it is very strong in group battles because it can be done attack and defence.
            It is difficult to take stuns and downs, and the performance against players is quite low 
            because there is no even skill of slow the speed of enemy.</p>
